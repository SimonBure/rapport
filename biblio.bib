  abstract = {After reviewing the behavioral studies of working memory and of the cellular substrate of the latter, we argue that metastable states constitute candidates for the type of transient information storage required by working memory. We then present a simple neural network model made of stochastic units whose synapses exhibit short-term facilitation. The Markov process dynamics of this model was specifically designed to be analytically tractable, simple to simulate numerically and to exhibit a quasistationary distribution (QSD). Since the state space is finite this QSD is also a Yaglom limit, which allows us to bridge the gap between quasi-stationarity and metastability by considering the relative orders of magnitude of the relaxation and absorption times. We present first analytical results: characterization of the absorbing region of the Markov process, irreducibility outside this absorbing region and consequently existence and uniqueness of a QSD. We then apply Perron-Frobenius spectral analysis to obtain any specific QSD, and design an approximate method for the first moments of this QSD when the exact method is intractable. Finally we use these methods to study the relaxation time toward the QSD and establish numerically the memorylessness of the time of extinction.},

  abstract = {The time to absorption from the set T of transient states of a Markov chain may be sufficiently long for the probability distribution over T to settle down in some sense to a "quasi-stationary" distribution. Various analogues of the stationary distribution of an irreducible chain are suggested and compared. The reverse process of an absorbing chain is found to be relevant.},
